Uploaded old project:
In my Mobile Apps class, I teamed up with two classmates to develop an Android app called Taskr. The app is functionally similar to TaskRabbit, connecting users who need help with tasks to those willing to complete them. We used Firebase for the backend database, ensuring real-time updates and reliable data storage, and developed the app in Android Studio. The project was a great opportunity to learn about mobile app development while creating a practical solution for everyday needs.
